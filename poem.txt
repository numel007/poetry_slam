1: Now, said the cook, I will teach you
2: how to stuff a pepper with rice.
3: Take your pepper green, and gently,
4: for peppers are shy.  No matter which side
5: you approach, it's always the backside.
6: Perched on green buttocks, the pepper sleeps.
7: In its silk tights, it dreams
8: of somersaults and parsley,
9: of the days when the sexes were one.
10: Slash open the sleeve
11: as if you were cutting a paper lantern,
12: and enter a moon, spilled like a melon,
13: a fever of pearls,
14: a conversation of glaciers.
15: It is a temple built to the worship
16: of morning light.
17: I have sat under the great globe
18: of seeds on the roof of that chamber,
19: too dazzled to gather the taste I came for.
20: I have taken the pepper in hand,
21: smooth and blind, a runt in the rich
22: evolution of roses and ferns.
23: You say I have not yet taught you
24: to stuff a pepper?
25: Cooking takes time.
26: Next time we'll consider the rice.
